# 📘 Oracle Learning Repository

Welcome to my **Oracle Learning Repository**! 🚀
This repo contains my notes, exercises, and hands-on coding projects from the **Oracle AI and Data Platform certification tracks**.

I use **Google Colab** as my primary coding environment because of its:

* ⚡ Easy access to Python and AI/ML libraries
* ☁️ Smooth integration with datasets and APIs
* 🤖 AI-assisted coding convenience
